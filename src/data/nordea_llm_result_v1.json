Additionally, there are several Prohibited Transaction Class Exemptions (PTCEs) available (Rule 5), which can provide relief for certain transactions involving Plans. While there are fiduciary burdens and restrictions (Rule 10), the presence of these exemptions and the operating company status suggest that the investment is ERISA eligible.
